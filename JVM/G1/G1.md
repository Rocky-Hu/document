# -XX:+UseG1GC

**官方解释**：

Enables the use of the garbage-first (G1) garbage collector. It is a server-style garbage collector, targeted for multiprocessor machines with a large amount of RAM. It meets GC pause time goals with high probability, while maintaining good throughput. The G1 collector is recommended for applications requiring large heaps (sizes of around 6 GB or larger) with limited GC latency requirements (stable and predictable pause time below 0.5 seconds).

By default, this option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on the configuration of the machine and type of the JVM.

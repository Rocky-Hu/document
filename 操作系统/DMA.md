什么是 DMA 技术？简单理解就是，**在进行 I/O 设备和内存的数据传输的时候，数据搬运的工作全部交给 DMA 控制器，而 CPU 不再参与任何与数据搬运相关的事情，这样 CPU 就可以去处理别的事务**。

**Direct memory access** (**DMA**) is a feature of computer systems that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_storage) ([random-access memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)) independently of the [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) (CPU).

Without DMA, when the CPU is using [programmed input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_input/output), it is typically fully occupied for the entire duration of the read or  write operation, and is thus unavailable to perform other work. With  DMA, the CPU first initiates the transfer, then it does other operations while the transfer is in progress, and it finally receives an [interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt) from the DMA controller (DMAC) when the operation is done. This feature is useful at any time that the CPU cannot keep up with the rate of data transfer, or when the CPU needs to perform work while waiting for a  relatively slow I/O data transfer. Many hardware systems use DMA,  including [disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_storage) controllers, [graphics cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_card), [network cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller) and [sound cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card). DMA is also used for intra-chip data transfer in [multi-core processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor). Computers that have DMA channels can transfer data to and from devices  with much less CPU overhead than computers without DMA channels.  Similarly, a [processing element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_element) inside a multi-core processor can transfer data to and from its local  memory without occupying its processor time, allowing computation and  data transfer to proceed in parallel.

DMA can also be used for "memory to memory" copying or moving of  data within memory. DMA can offload expensive memory operations, such as large copies or [scatter-gather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectored_I/O) operations, from the CPU to a dedicated DMA engine. An implementation example is the [I/O Acceleration Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_Acceleration_Technology). DMA is of interest in [network-on-chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_on_a_chip) and [in-memory computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-memory_processing) architectures.

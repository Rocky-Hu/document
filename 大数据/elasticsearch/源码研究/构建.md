`gradle assemble` seems to yield some errors such as `cannot find symbol` in my macOS environment.

According to the latest description in the repo (as of time writing the answer):

To build a distribution for your local OS and print its output location upon completion, run:

```
./gradlew localDistro
```

To build a distribution for another platform, run the related command:

```
./gradlew :distribution:archives:linux-tar:assemble
./gradlew :distribution:archives:darwin-tar:assemble
./gradlew :distribution:archives:windows-zip:assemble
```

To build distributions for all supported platforms, run:

```
./gradlew assemble
```

Distributions are output to distributions/archives

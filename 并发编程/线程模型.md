Simply stated, a threading model specifies key aspects of thread management in the context of an OS, programming language, framework, or application. How and when threads are created obviously has a significant impact on the execution of application code, so developers need to understand the trade-offs associated with different models. This is true whether they choose the model themselves or acquire it implicitly via the adoption of a language or framework.

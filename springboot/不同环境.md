We implemented the Spring active profiles in a slightly different way. Let's say the default properties file, `application.yml`, contains all default values which is same in both production and development environments.

Create separate properties for production and development files named `application-prd.yml` and `application-dev.yml` respectively. These files may contain extra properties or override some of the default properties.

During application startup, we pass the `spring.profiles.active` as an environment variable. For example,

```
-Dspring.profiles.active=prd
```

will pick up `application-prd.yml` along with `application.yml`

or

```
-Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```

will pick up `application-dev.yml` along with `application.yml`

因为poll和epoll对于突然中断的连接socket会对返回的eventSet事件集合置为EPOLLHUP或者EPOLLERR，**eventSet事件集合发生了变化**，这就导致Selector会被唤醒，如果仅仅是因为这个原因唤醒且没有感兴趣的时间发生的话，就会变成空轮询。 

```
This is an issue with poll (and epoll) on Linux. If a file descriptor for a connected socket is polled with a request event mask of 0, and if the connection is abruptly terminated (RST) then the poll wakes up with the POLLHUP (and maybe POLLERR) bit set in the returned event set. The implication of this behaviour is that Selector will wakeup and as the interest set for the SocketChannel is 0 it means there aren't any selected events and the select method returns 0.

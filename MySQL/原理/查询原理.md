~~~
Results are returned back to the client program as the execution proceeds. As rows ‘bubble’ up the execution tree, the top operator is usually tasked with writing these rows into network buffers and sending them to back to the client. The result is not created first into some intermediate storage (memory or disk) and then sent back to the client, instead it is sent back as is being created (as the query executes). Sending the result back to the client is, of course, subject to the network flow control protocol. If the client is not actively consuming the result (eg. by calling SqlDataReader.Read()) then eventually the flow control will have to block the sending side (the query that is being executed) and this in turn will suspend the execution of the query. The query resumes and produces more results (continue iterating the execution plan) as soon as the network flow control relieves the required network resources.
